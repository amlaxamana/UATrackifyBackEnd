The UA-Trackify system is intended to help the University of the Assumption's 
approved student organizations and executive committee by digitizing the 
process of managing activity forms.  It makes it easier, faster, and less stressful 
for groups to produce and submit activity forms.  The system allows student 
organizations to simply add activity data and track the progress of their 
submitted documents in real time.  The executive committee, on the other hand, 
may evaluate, update, approve, or delete submitted forms based on their 
accuracy and completeness.  Overall, UA-Trackify ensures an orderly and 
transparent workflow that replaces previous manual document tracking 
methods.
